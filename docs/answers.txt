a. On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean

b. there have been 6 changes. I used git rev-list --all --count

c. Date:   Thu Jan 10 16:45:38 2019 -0500
git log .gitignore

d. branches in Git allow devs to work on the same project at the same time without interfering with other peoples work.
by using branches it eliminates the possiblity of someone overwriting another devs work or even overwriting their work.

e. git log states all changes that has been done in the repository aswell as who has made the changes and what time

git status only checks to see if the files are currently up to date with the files in the repository.

f. git log --follow Weapon.h

g. git log --all --grep='file'
